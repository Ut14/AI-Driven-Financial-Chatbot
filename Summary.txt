The financial chatbot is a rule-based AI-driven system designed to answer financial queries about specific companies (Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple) for the fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024. It leverages data from two CSV files: final_data_report.csv and Summary_final_report.csv. Here's a brief summary of how it works:

User Interaction:

The chatbot initiates a session when the user inputs "Hi".
It prompts the user to select a company from a list of three (Microsoft, Tesla, Apple).
The user is then asked to input a fiscal year (2022, 2023, or 2024).
Query Handling:

The chatbot asks the user to enter a query related to the selected company and fiscal year.
It checks the user's query against a predefined set of questions:
Total Revenue
Net Income
Total Assets
Total Liabilities
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Revenue Growth (%)
Net Income Growth (%)
Assets Growth (%)
Liabilities Growth (%)
Cash Flow from Operations Growth (%)
Year-by-Year Average Revenue Growth Rate (%)
Year-by-Year Average Net Income Growth Rate (%)
Year-by-Year Average Assets Growth Rate (%)
Year-by-Year Average Liabilities Growth Rate (%)
Year-by-Year Average Cash Flow from Operations Growth Rate (%)
Data Retrieval and Response:

The chatbot retrieves relevant data from the final_data_report or summary_report DataFrames based on the user's query.
It returns the financial information specific to the selected company and fiscal year.
Exit Condition:

The user can type "exit" to end the chatbot session at any time.
Error Handling:

If the user inputs an invalid company name or fiscal year, the chatbot prompts the user to restart the session.
If the user inputs an unrecognized query, the chatbot returns a message indicating that it cannot provide information on the requested query.
